# state-tutorial
I wrote this tutorial (with confetti included) to help a friend practice their React state & lifecycle skills.
It was built around class components (somewhat outdated now), but was still fun to use!

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Go to `Stages/Stage01.jsx`. The `testMyCode()` function has instructions on how to begin.
